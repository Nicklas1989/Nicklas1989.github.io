# Stationen

This example shows a number of stations. It is only build with Aframe. No use of Javascript.
Each station shows of some capabilities of Aframe.

The goal is to give people without any codeing skills the tools to build their own world with Aframe.

This example is part of my bachelor thesis at HS Pforzheim, Germany.
